There continues to be upper zone vascular redistribution, similar when compared to the previous study compatible with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Lungs remain hyperinflated compatible with COPD. Linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with scarring. Small bilateral pleural effusions are relatively unchanged.
